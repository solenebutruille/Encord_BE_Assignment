An automated test suite will be run against your submission. To make sure that it will run well 
please
* Add installation instructions to make your `tetris` executable runnable into the README.md.
    If you are using Python you might also include the dependencies you are introducing
    with a `requirements.txt` file.
* Run these sample tests against the executable you have produced. Please note, if you're using
    Windows you will need to modify the `subprocess.run` command accordingly.
